# website_01
First practice website for workflow.
This is a multi-part process.
This being the portfolio section of the website.

This site is not complete, but I learned a lot.  It is one of many to see how quickly I can get a site up in one day.  I chalk this up as successful on helping me to remember css and html.  It was a failure in my understanding of page flow.  But I will take notice of future issues.
